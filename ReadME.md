# Additive Cipher
Additive ciphers, also known as shift ciphers or Caesar ciphers, are a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of positions down or up the alphabet to create the corresponding ciphertext. This type of encryption is one of the simplest and oldest methods of encrypting messages.

The name "Caesar cipher" comes from Julius Caesar, who used this method to communicate secretly with his military generals. The Caesar cipher is a specific case of the additive cipher, where the shift is always three positions to the right.

Here's an example of how a Caesar cipher works with a shift of 3:

Plaintext: HELLO
Shift: 3
Ciphertext: KHOOR

In this example, each letter in the plaintext is shifted three positions to the right in the alphabet. So, 'H' becomes 'K', 'E' becomes 'H', 'L' becomes 'O', and so on.

To decrypt a Caesar cipher, you simply shift the letters in the opposite direction. If the shift was 3 to the right, you would shift 3 to the left to recover the original plaintext.

## Examples
<b> Encryption </b>

> Type the plain text to encrypt: HELLO

> Enter the key: 3

> Plain Text: HELLO

> Encrypted Text: KHOOR

<b> Decryption </b>

> Type the Encrypted text to decrypt: KHOOR

> Enter the key: 3

> Encrypted Text : KHOOR

> Decrypted Text : HELLO

<b> Final </b> (Default key = 7. It also generates a .txt file containing all the usernames and passwords in the encrypted form.)

> Enter username: abcd

> Enter password: efgh

> Do you wish to read all entries?(y/n): y

> Username: hijk

> Password: lmno
